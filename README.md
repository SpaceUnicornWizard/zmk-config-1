# Seth's Corne Layout

This is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org">miryoku layout</a> for the corne keyboard using the ZMK Firmware.

It modifies miryoku in that it removes the dedicated layer for mouse movements and shifted numbers as ZMK did not support these fully at the time of implementation, and I didn't want them anyway.
